Ayschronous code:
	Testing the ayschronous code with mocha could not be a simpler.
	it simply invoke the callback when the test is completed.
	by adding the callback done to it();
Synchronous code:
	When testing synchronous code, omit the callback and Mocha will automatically continue on to the next test.
Hooks:
	* With its default "BDD"-style interface, Mocha provides the hooks before(), after(), beforeEach(), and afterEach().
	These should be used to set up preconditions and clean up after your tests.
	* Tests can appear before, after, or interspersed with your hooks. Hooks will run in the order they are defined, as appropriate; 
	all before() hooks run (once), then any beforeEach() hooks, tests, any afterEach() hooks, and finally after() hooks (once).
